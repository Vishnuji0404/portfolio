        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Project 1: REAL WORLD ENTREPRENEURSHIP</li>

<li>We began by brainstorming potential business ideas that would cater to our target 
customers—individuals living in hostels or as paying guests. After considering several 
options, including setting up food stalls and selling handcrafted goods, we decided to focus 
on selling essential everyday items such as baskets, containers, water bottles, hair clips, 
scrunchies, socks, and handkerchiefs. This choice was made based on the need for 
cost-effective, high-demand products that would be easy to source and quick to sell. 
The project was executed in phases, starting with a market visit to Hatibagan Market in 
Kolkata, where we purchased our initial stock after negotiating with vendors. Our sales 
strategy included both online and offline promotions, targeting hostel and PG residents 
through word-of-mouth marketing, WhatsApp groups, and personal networks. We managed 
our finances carefully, tracking every transaction to ensure profitability while keeping prices 
competitive to attract more customers. 
Despite several challenges—such as coordinating group efforts, managing finances, and 
balancing academic schedules—our team implemented strategic measures to overcome these 
hurdles. We successfully completed three phases of product purchases and sales, gradually 
increasing our revenue and reinvesting profits into subsequent inventory rounds. 
By the end of the project, we turned our initial investment of ₹1000 into a net profit of 
₹1214.50. This project provided us with invaluable insights into the fundamentals of 
entrepreneurship, including the importance of teamwork, market research, strategic planning, 
and financial discipline. Overall, it was a highly educational and rewarding experience that 
has prepared us to tackle similar business challenges in the future.</li>
